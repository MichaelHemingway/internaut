	<h1>The Collection</h1>

	<p>The collection is my content graveyard; It's made of the things that didn't quite make it to the projects, or weren't mine and I just wanted to save. It's like a blog, but for more than just writing.</p>

	<% for (let i = 0; i < site.collection.length; i++) {

		<article class="card">
			<a href="<%= `${p.page.type}/${p.path}` %>"><%= p.page.title %></a>

		</article>
