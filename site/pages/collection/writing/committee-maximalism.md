Quotidian and all too common is the frustration shampoo bottles impart on me when I'm looking to use them. Paragraphs of nonsense claims set over meaningless graphics so often obscure the very nature of the bottle that only in some puny font, set far away from the main typographic event, will the _"hey, this is shampoo"_ notion be conveyed.

I don't mean to claim the coinage or discovery of design by committee, but merely wonder why it's so prevalent, and why it manifests as a sort of particular brand of maximalism.
