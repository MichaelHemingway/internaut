# The organization app

Jars was the longest-running under-development app I've made to date by technicality:

Jars is an ongoing, under-development project of mine built with the foremost goal of replacing and streamlining the three markdown documents I currently organize my life with.

It started as a way to formalize and keep record of the markdown documents that precede it: today.md, week.md &amp; notes.md among others.

I started development with a Vue and Electron framework hybrid, to teach myself both. I think in that regard it's been a wild succes, and I learned ES6 along the way as well.

Current efforts are now focused on integrating Google Calendar, and altering the user interface to reflect a focus on impromptu logging instead of after-the-fact commits.

Inspiration for the project in it's current form borrows from <a href="https://joshavanier.github.io/">Josh Avanier's</a> <a href="https://joshavanier.github.io/wiki/log/">log</a>. And other similar works.
