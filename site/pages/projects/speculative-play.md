# Speculative Play

Speculative Play was a long-running redesign of the eponymous research groups's webpage. The redesign turns the experience of navigating the web into an abstract ring of interconnected spaces. Functionally rendered as interactive, 3D scenes, the user may explore the work and biographies of artists working in the research group represented in in this alternate internate space.

Work progressed through various iterations, with a considerable portion entertaining a design that presented the ultimately free-form spaces as rooms.

Navigation and textual content was presented via an on-screen console, styled like terminal windows of early DOS computers. The middle image shows a earlier prototype where navigation commands were to be presented in a separate panel. The last image in this sequence depicts a room model with transitional elements from the earliest design iteration.</figcaption>
