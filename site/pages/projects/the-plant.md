# The Plant

The plant is a long running project and service of mine. It's Dawson College's official student newspaper, publishing bi-weekly over print and daily online.

The design of the plant was heavily inspired by the sites we (the plant editorial team at the time) identified as those we most wanted to associate with. Wired magazine, Vox and Vice played a heavy stylistic role to the actual design, while I designed the information architecture and backend of the site to suit the needs of the small team.

Early design progressed with these categories in mind, the division of interests amongst the student body led to the creation of separate mini-sites within the plant.

Customization, theming and the adaptation of the plant to events and seasons was paramount. The print covers of the issue were after all, the most loved feature of the print edition.

The addition of video, gifs and user submissions embraced the potential of the web, something that the first plant administration I'd worked with was keen on exploring.

Through the website, the plant newspaper saw a sixth of the college's population in readership, far above the former print numbers. Beating out the old, abandoned WordPress blog at SEO certainly helped.

My role in the design and creation of the site, start to finish, has me now as a occasional custodian. I still plan and implement revisions, theme updates and the like. For now, you can get a taste of the admin side of things with the [original editor's guide](/assets/img/work/theplant/the_little_green book_v.2.1.pdf) and by visiting [the plant](http://theplantnewspaper.com) for yourself.
